                    <h1>Better than the first.</h1>
                    <h2>9/10</h2>
                    <p>This movie was great--much better than the original film, which was pretty standard as far as summer blockbusters go. X-2 skipped all the awkward and unnecessary attempts at a backstory (and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the XMen when I saw the film) and went straight for an intelligent route. The characters were fascinating and the special effects were truly pretty good--and that's saying something, since I'm usually bored out of my mind by that kind of thing.Some of the acting was absolutely wonderful. Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Ian McKellen, Alan Cummings, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin more than made up for the mediocre attempts of Halle Berry and Famke Janssen.</p>

                    <h1>More Of Same Eye-Popping FX</h1>
                    <h2>8/10</h2>
                        <p>Since the first movie, "X-Men," was famous for its great special effects, this sequel knew enough to deliver the same kind of eye-popping effects to please its fans....and it did! There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects, both visually and audibly. All of that means very few lulls in this 134-minute film.

                            Having said that, I do think the film needed some lulls. At over two hours of pretty intense action, it needed more breaks. It's just too much. Either that, or shorten the story.
                            
                            Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, in her skin-tight outfit, is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad, either! Other familiar names from the first film are still here, such as Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan.
                            
                            It's a pretty interesting story and although they state evolution "as a fact" early on once again, they do have something unusual in today's films: a Christian character who was a good guy.
                            
                            All in all, if you liked the first film, you'll like this.</p>

                    <h1>X2</h1>
                    <h2>9/10</h2>
                        <p>X2 takes what the first film did and improves upon it. The story is very interesting and it's cool to see the heroes and the villain from the last film working together. This film is also darker then that first which I liked. There is more action, with the Wolverine in the school scene being a standout. The cast is really good again and there are some great new additions. Night crawler was probably my most favourite new addition. The villain was quite good as well. X2 is an example of how a sequel can be better then it's predecessor.</p>
